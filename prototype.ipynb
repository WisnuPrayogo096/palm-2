      "The model is trained using a technique called under-sampling, which helps to reduce the impact of data imbalance in the dataset. The dataset is divided into training, validation, and test sets. The training set is used to train the model, the validation set is used to evaluate the model's performance, and the test set is used to assess the model's performance on unseen data.\n",
      "\n",
      "The model is evaluated using the following metrics: accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. Accuracy is the percentage of images that are correctly classified. Precision is the percentage of images that are classified as positive that are actually positive. Recall is the percentage of positive images that are correctly classified. F1 score is a measure of the model's overall performance.\n",
      "\n",
      "The results show that the model achieves an accuracy of 96% on the test set. This is a significant improvement over previous methods, which have achieved accuracies of around 80%. The model is also more stable than previous methods, with a lower variance in performance.\n",
