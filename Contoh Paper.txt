This research focuses on developing an image classification model to improve cataract diagnosis. The Inception-ResNetV2  method  was  chosen because  of  its  ability  to  extract  image  features.  Under-sampling  techniques  are used  to  overcome  data  imbalance  in  the dataset.  The  dataset  consists  of  6,162  eye  fundus  images  with  two classes:  cataract  and  normal.  Initial  processing  includes normalization  of  normal  class  data  and  adjustment  of image size to 224x224 pixels. The dataset is divided into training (80%), validation (10%), and test (10%) data. Data  augmentation  is  used  to  improve  the  quality  of  training  data.  The  model  is  built with  three  Dense  layers, three  Dropout  layers,  three  Batch  Normalization,  and  an  output  layer  for  class  classification. Experimental results  show  that  both  models  achieve  an  accuracy  of  around  96%.  Model  1  has  more  stable  performance compared to model 2. The research also compares the results with previous research, showing differences in the types  of  motives  and  transfer learning  methods.  In  conclusion,  this  study  suggests  the  use  of  the  Inception  V2 model  with  under-sampling  techniques  to improve  cataract  diagnosis.  Both  models  have  high  accuracy,  but model  1  is  more  stable.  Under-sampling  techniques  are  key  in  dealing  with  data  imbalances  that  affect  model performance.

It is crucial to realize the municipal solid waste (MSW) classification in terms of its treatments and disposals. Deep learning used for the classification of residual waste and wet waste from MSW was considered as a promising method. While few studies reported using the method of deep learning with transfer learning to classify organic waste and residual waste. Thus, this study aims to discuss the effect of the transfer learning on the performance of different deep learning structures, VGGNet-16 and ResNet-50, for the classification of organic waste and residual waste, which were compared in terms of the training time, confusion matric, accuracy, precision, and recall. In addition, the algorithms of PCA and t-SNE were also adopted to compare the representation extracted from the last layer of various deep learning models. Results indicated that transfer learning could shorten the training time and the training time of various deep learning follows this order: VGGNet-16 (402 s) > VGGNet-16 with TL (272 s) > ResNet-50 (238 s) > ResNet-50 with TL (223 s). Compared with the method of PAC, waste representations were better separated from high dimension to low dimension by t-SNE. The values of organic waste in terms of F1 score follows this order: ResNet-50 with transfer learning (97.8%) > VGGNet-16 with transfer learning (97.1%) > VGGNet-16 (95.0%) > ResNet-50 (92.5%).Therefore, the best performance for the classification of organic and residual waste was ResNet-50 with transfer learning, followed by VGGNet-16 with transfer learning and VGGNet-16, and ResNet-50 in terms of accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score

Among mind cancers, gliomas are the most typical and forceful, principal to an exceptionally short presence hope of their greatest grade. Thusly, cure making arrangements is a vital stage to upgrade the excellent of presence of oncological patients. Attractive Resonance Imaging (MRI) is a broadly utilized imaging technique to survey these growths, however the monstrous amount of data created through MRI forestalls guide division in an economical time, forbidding the utilization of exact quantitative estimations inside the clinical activity. Thus, programmed and solid division techniques are required, be that as it may, the enormous spatial and primary inconstancy among mind growths make modernized division an extreme issue. To explore involving force standardization as a pre-handling step, which albeit at this point not typical in CNN (Convolutional Neural organization) accomplishes uncommon execution in picture handling and PC vision.
